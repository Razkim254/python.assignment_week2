List Operations in Python
This simple Python script demonstrates basic operations on a list, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.

ðŸ“œ Description
The script performs the following steps on a list named my_list:

Create an empty list

Append elements: Adds the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Insert an element: Inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extend the list: Adds another list [50, 60, 70] to the end of my_list.

Remove the last element: Removes the last item in the list (which is 70 after extension).

Sort the list: Sorts all elements in ascending order.

Find the index of a value: Finds and prints the index of the value 30.
